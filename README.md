# Resume-Selection
This project automates resume screening using machine learning techniques. By leveraging text processing and classification algorithms, it categorizes resumes into predefined job roles, making the recruitment process faster and more efficient. 
<br>
This repository contains a Python project that uses Machine Learning techniques to automate and improve the process of resume screening and selection. The project leverages scikit-learn for text feature extraction and classification to categorize resumes into relevant job roles or classes.
<br>
üìå Project Overview
<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can efficiently classify resumes based on their content. The classification process involves:
<br>
Preprocessing text data from resumes.<br>
Extracting relevant features using methods like CountVectorizer.<br>
Training a Naive Bayes Classifier to categorize resumes into predefined classes.<br>
This project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics and machine learning in HR processes, saving time and improving accuracy in resume evaluation.

üõ†Ô∏è Features<br>
Text Preprocessing: Transform raw text data into a numerical format suitable for ML models.<br>
Feature Extraction: Uses CountVectorizer for converting text into a bag-of-words model.<br>
Naive Bayes Classifier: Implements a MultinomialNB model for classification.<br>
Train-Test Split: Evaluates model performance using an 80/20 split.<br>
Scikit-Learn Integration: Built entirely using Python's scikit-learn library.<br>
